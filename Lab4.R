fruit <- c(86, 75, 72, 88, 87, 79, 92, 84)
veggie <- c(85, 91, 88, 89, 95, 96, 92, 95, 94)
mu1 = mean(fruit)
mu2 = mean(veggie)
mu1 - mu2
t.test(x = fruit, y = veggie, alternative = "two.sided", mu = 0, conf.level = .95)

#Part B
t.test(x = fruit, y = veggie, alternative = "two.sided", mu = 0, conf.level = .95)

hist(x = fruit)
hist(x = veggie)

#Because these are small samples with non-normal distribution, the t-test is likely less than valid
